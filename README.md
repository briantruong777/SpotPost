How To Launch Development Site
--------

### First time setup
1. Install python2.7 and virtualenv
2. Make a directory for the project and go into it
3. Run `git clone` with the git url
4. Make a directory called `venv` inside here
5. Run `virtualenv venv`
6. Run `. venv/bin/activate`
7. Run `pip install flask`
8. If you are done, run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment

### Daily Development
1. Go to project directory
2. Run `. venv/bin/activate`
3. Enter the git repo directory
4. Run `python main.py`

You will now have a server running on `localhost:5000` that you can access in
your web browser. Feel free to do development and make commits inside the
virtual environment.

5. Run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment
